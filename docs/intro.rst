What is rdaclient.py?
---------------------
Rdaclient.py is an asynchronous RDA client with buffer, written in pure python (with extensive usage of ctypes). Remote Data Access protocol is used by the the BrainVision recording software to share EEG the data over the network.

For BrainAmp (by Brain Products) users, the module is aimed to simplify the development of processing applications (including BCIs) by encapsulating an asynchronous network client and a circular buffer in a single module. For in-depth description, refer to :doc:`details`.
